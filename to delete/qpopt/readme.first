 The linear and quadratic programming routines lpopt and qpopt
come in three flavors:

 1. The main directory qpopt is the root of the directory
    structure with files for Unix/Linux systems.

 2. The subdirectory qpopt/DOS contains qpopt files suitable for
    running under DOS.

 3. The subdirectory qpopt/VMS contains qpopt files suitable for
    running under VMS.
