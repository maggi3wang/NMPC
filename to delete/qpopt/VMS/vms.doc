To install LPOPT/QPOPT on DEC VAX/VMS systems, proceed as follows.

 1. Transfer all files from the floppy disk to a directory
    of your choice.  For descriptive purposes we
    suppose that the directory is [me.qpopt].

 2. Set the default directory:
          set default [me.qpopt.VMS]

 4. Define "make" to mean "execute vmsmake.com":
          make :== @[me.qpopt]vmsmake
    (This could be done permanently in your login.com file.)

 5. Edit the file  qpoptmain.for  and change the assignment of the
    logical variable  byname  so that default Fortran unit numbers
    of the form for004, etc., are used by the example program.
          Change    byname = .true.   to    byname = .false.

 6. Create subdirectories to contain "debug" and "optimized" object code:
          create /dir [.dbg]
          create /dir [.opt]
    We will use only the [.opt] directory here.  See vmsmake.com for
    discussion of the [.dbg] directory.

 7. Enter the directory for optimized code:
          set def [.opt]

 8. Compile and link, using the files qpopt.mak and qpopt.lnk
    and creating qpopt.exe:
          make qpopt
    (Ignore messages about missing .obj files.  They are being created
    for the first time!  Next time you do "make" they won't appear.)

 9. Run the test program, using the supplied data file qpopt.opt:
       copy [-]qpopt.opt []
       open/read    for004 qpoptmain.opt
       define/nolog for009 qpoptmain.lis
       define/nolog for010 qpoptmain.sum
       run qpoptmain
       close for004
    Compare results with the QPOPT User's Guide.

10. Solution of further problems requires user-specific code
    (the main program) and files *.mak, *.lnk, *.opt similar to those
    used above. A *.com file would be useful for doing most of the
    commands in the preceding step.

11. If qpopt is to be used by many people, it may be appropriate to
    dispense with the "make" facility and use an object library.
